# Motivation
I've recently bought the Wallpaper Engine and it bugged me that I can't do much with workshop contents. I then reverse engineered the pkg file and I've managed to develop somewhat stable tool to extract, list and repack the contents of a, so called, `PKGV0001` filesystem/package structure. I'm happy to accept feedback and pull requests/issues on this tool and to keep working on it if it gains some interest.

Extract it!<br>
![image](https://i.imgur.com/0rsDzlD.png)
It should extract to a tmp folder. Don't touch it! Edit contents or do whatever you like inside of it.<br>
![image](https://i.imgur.com/aM7c4jz.png)
Inside are the standard files of a Wallpaper Engine project. You can paste them into a new project and edit them. Don't forget to place everything into the tmp folder after you finish!<br><br>
Now simply repack it! `./we r scene.pkg`<br>

Now there's the freshly repacked file!<br>
![image](https://i.imgur.com/r3YyzZo.png)
Copy all of the old files except scene.pkg into a freshly created project and paste in your repacked `scene.pkg`<br><br>
## MAC - DOESNT WORK
Required:<br>
* Macport or Brew (for install libboost)
* Xcode and the Xcode Command Line Tools
* libboost


# Usage
1. install Xcode and the Xcode Command Line Tools

2. install libboost : `brew install boost`(When you installed Brew) or `sudo port install boost`(When you installed Macport)

2-1. If you don't have brew : `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null`

2-2. If you don't have Macport : Install [Macport](https://www.macports.org/) and reboot.

3. `make linux`

4. `./we x scene.pkg`

5. `./we r scene.pkg`


## That's it!
Now you've successfully modified and repacked the workshop item. <br>You can now, after all of this, use it as a your wallpaper.<br>
Thanks for tuning in!
